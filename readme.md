# Russian Roulette Bash Script

Welcome to the most chaotic game of **Russian Roulette** you'll ever play‚Äîstraight from your terminal! üòà

### What is this?
This Bash script simulates a game of Russian Roulette:
- **If you win**, the script self-destructs.
- **If you lose**, the script sets a **cursed alias**: `cd="sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root"`‚Äîwhich can lead to **catastrophic damage** if you run `cd` in the terminal.

### WARNING:
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN** this script on anything important! ‚ö†Ô∏è  
It is designed to be fun and chaotic, but **losing** the game will result in a **deadly alias** that could **erase everything** from your system.

Use **at your own risk**. **Proceed with caution!**

---

### How to run:

1. **Download** the `russian_roulette.sh` script.
2. **Make it executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x russian_roulette.sh
